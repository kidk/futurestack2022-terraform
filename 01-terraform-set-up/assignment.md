Setting up Terraform
==============

Welcome to the hands on New Relic with Terraform workshop. We will guide you in creating you first Terraform resources. During this workshop you will learn to create alerts, synthetic checks, dashboards, workloads and SLI's all automated and generated through Terraform. If you're new to Terraform you will learn some key concepts you will be able to use with other providers.

The first step in using Terraform is setting up the providers with the right credentials. Open `providers.tf` in the local editor.
